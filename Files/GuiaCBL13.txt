Challenge.

The Challenge turns the Essential Question into a call to action by charging participants to learn about the subject.
A Challenge is immediate, actionable and builds excitement.
Choosing and setting up the Challenge is crucial. If it is interesting and sufficiently close to home, students will derive personal meaning and feel a sense of accomplishment upon understanding the content, proposing and implementing a Solution. If the Challenge also has greater global significance, students will gain confidence and self-esteem as they engage with issues they know to be truly important.
If the Challenge is too broad or vague, the Learners will struggle. If it is too narrow, they will not be able to experience the self-direction that is required to develop the skills that Challenge Based Learning cultivates. Challenges should be difficult and have multiple possibilities for Solutions, as well as organized and scaffolded to support the Learners.
The amount of time the Learners have to work on the Challenge is also important. Some Challenges can be addressed in a day or a week, while others need a semester or even an entire school year. If the Challenge is too big for the allotted time, the Learners will feel pressured or frustrated. If it is too small, they will lose interest.
The Challenge identification stage is another point where the Learners can begin to move into groups if they have not done so already. Having multiple groups working on one Challenge is efficient while still providing the possibilities of having multiple Solutions.
Finally, it is important for the Challenge to be real and meaningful to the Learners. If a Challenge is contrived or something that the Learners cannot personally connect with, they will not fully engage in the process.
