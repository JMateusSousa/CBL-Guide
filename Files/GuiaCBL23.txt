Analysis.

Once all of the Guiding Questions have been addressed, and the results of the Guiding Activities recorded,
the Learners analyze the accumulated data and identify themes. The goal is for the Learners to move from a
list of findings to research conclusions. An example conclusion from the Health Challenge might be that the
most important aspects of being healthy include nutrition and diet are dependent on access to certain types of food.

The Investigation phase concludes with reports and presentations where the Learners demonstrate they have
successfully answered all of the Guiding Questions, addressed curriculum standards, and developed clear conclusions
that will set the foundation for the solution.

During the Investigation supply (just) enough structure (boundaries of adventure). Challenge Based Learning is meant
to be a free-flowing process in which students are allowed to search, struggle, re-focus, and learn through making mistakes.
The amount of structure provided depends on the maturity of the students. Give them freedom to explore, but make sure
there are boundaries, so they do not get completely lost. Structure for this phase can include providing an initial set
of Guiding Resources, including a focused set of relevant and credible sources.â€¨
