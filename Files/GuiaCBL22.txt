Guiding Activities and Resources.
Next, the Learners review the highest priority questions and begin to identify Guiding Activities and Resources that can be used to answer them. Many options available for Guiding Activities and Resources: online databases and journals, online courses, the school or public library, social networks, local experts or experts located anywhere in the world via the web. Guiding activities can include simulations, experiments, projects, problem sets, research, games, expert interviews, surveys, lectures, and textbook assignments.
Any resource or activity that helps uncover the knowledge needed to answer the Guiding Questions and to develop an innovative, insightful, and realistic Solution is valuable. In the Health Challenge example, resources and activities might include interviews with physicians, research using online databases and participation in an online course about nutrition.
