Essential Questioning.

After identifying the Big Idea, the next step is for the Learners to contextualize and build personal connections.
    
The Essential Questioning process is set up to allow the Learners to begin asking personal questions about the Big
Idea(e.g. Why is this important to me? Where does this concept intersect with my world? etc.) By asking personal
and contextual questions, the Learners begin to narrow and personalize the focus.

Essential Questioning can be an individual or group activity and provides the opportunity to explore language and
develop a common vocabulary that will support the process.

The Essential Questioning process leads to the identification of questions that have personal meaning to the
individual or group. Most Big Ideas will generate a variety of Essential Questions. The number of Essential Questions
moving forward will be dictated by factors such as time, learning goals, numbers of Learners and management concerns.
