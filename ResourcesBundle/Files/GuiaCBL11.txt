Big Idea.

A Big Idea is a broad concept that can be explored in multiple ways and is relevant to Learners, and the larger community. Examples of Big Ideas include Community, Relationships, Creativity, Health, Sustainability, and Democracy.
Big Ideas can often be correlated with curriculum themes and have inherent cross-curricular potential. A good place to look for Big Ideas is major news stories, social media trends, upcoming events, discussions with community members and personal reflection. When Big Ideas reflect the immediate concerns and interests of the Learners, the resulting Challenges are meaningful and engaging.
For example - “Relationships” is an excellent Big Idea for Learners because it is both a pressing personal concern and fits within all academic disciplines. Understanding relationships are critical in different ways across all content areas. In the sciences, it can be explored at the molecular or ecosystem level. In math, understanding the relationships between variables is critical. Language Arts, Socials Studies, Arts, etc. all have connections with relationships.
When planning, it can be valuable to think with the “end in mind” and consider how Big Ideas can be introduced at the appropriate time to address specific curriculum goals and standards.
